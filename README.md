# Feedreader Testing

This is one of my projects for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program to practice testing with JASMINE. For the source code from Udacity, see the original repository.

## How to run the application

Download the .zip folder and unpack it. Open the index.html to see both the feed reader and the tests.
